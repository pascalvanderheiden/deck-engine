I'm reaching out because you're exactly the kind of engineer we want on stage.

We're launching the GitHub AI Adoption Series — an exclusive, demo-first program for our top strategic enterprise customers in the Netherlands. We're hand-picking a small group of exceptional speakers from GitHub and Microsoft Engineering, and your name came up immediately.

Why you? You're already living in the AI-first engineering world our customers are trying to reach. You don't just talk about Copilot — you ship with it. That authenticity is exactly what makes this program different from every other webinar out there.

What we're asking:

🎤 One 30–40 minute live demo on [Topic] — no slides, just you and your IDE
📅 Bi-weekly cadence, 1-hour sessions — you'd present once (or more if you want to come back)
👥 Audience: 200+ engineers from companies like ING, ASML, Shell, Philips, ABN Amro, Rabobank
🌟 Recognition: Featured speaker profile, cross-published content, and direct visibility with enterprise engineering leaders

This isn't a generic ask. The lineup is intentionally small and curated — every speaker is someone who's ahead of the curve. Being part of this series is a chance to shape how the next generation of enterprise engineers works with AI.

We'll handle all the logistics, audience management, and promotion. All we need from you is the demo you'd probably give at a team brown bag — just to a much bigger room.

Can we find 15 minutes to chat this week?

Cheers,
